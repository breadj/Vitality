This section shows how the map/level files in 'Levels' are formatted, how they can be changed, and how they can be made.

It also contains the overview and analysis I did on Dark Souls and similar games, seeing what I wanted within my game (before I decided I wanted to make an engine). Some of the research I did for this ended up in Capstone Final Report chapter 1.2 Defining 'Soulslike'.

The example game only has two small maps. It is run using the MonoGame extension to Microsoft Visual Studio.
